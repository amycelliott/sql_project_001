# sql_project_001
This is just a small quick test to see how to put a basic project together using these GitHub Files and SQL Fiddle

This is set up to use the MySql 5.6 Version for SQL Fiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/c20538/1

**Using SQL Fiddle:**
(1) Copy the SQL File that has the query to create the tables and insert the records.  
(2) Paste the SQL into the left window, then click "Build Schema" 
(3) Once it's ran successfuly, you can view the schema by clicking on "Browser" or enter your SQL in the right window.
